This is my version of the DXR inherited from here. https://landelare.github.io/2023/02/18/dxr-tutorial.html


This code is a comprehensive example of a DirectX Raytracing (DXR) application using DirectX 12 (D3D12). It covers the entire workflow of a basic DXR application, including window creation, device initialization, resource management, and rendering. Here's an overview of the key parts of the code:

<h2> Window Creation and Main Loop: </h2>

The main function sets up a window class and window for the application, initializes DirectX resources, and enters the main message loop. During each loop iteration, Render is called to draw the next frame.
Initialization Functions:

- Init: Initializes various components of the DirectX application.
- InitDevice: Sets up the D3D12 device and command queue.
- InitSurfaces: Initializes the swap chain for image presentation and a descriptor heap for unordered access views (UAVs).
- InitCommand: Creates command allocator and command list.
- InitMeshes: Prepares vertex and index buffers for rendering.
- InitBottomLevel: Creates bottom-level acceleration structures (BLAS) for ray tracing.
- InitScene: Sets up the scene with instances for ray tracing.
- InitTopLevel: Creates a top-level acceleration structure (TLAS) for ray tracing.
- InitRootSignature: Defines the root signature for shader binding.
- InitPipeline: Sets up the ray tracing pipeline state object (PSO).

<h2> Rendering and Resource Management:</h2>

- Render: Main rendering function. It updates the scene, sets up the ray tracing pipeline, and dispatches ray tracing commands.
- Resize: Handles window resizing and updates the render target accordingly.
- Flush: Synchronizes GPU execution to ensure all commands have been completed.

<h2> Ray Tracing Specifics </h2>
 
The application utilizes DXR for ray tracing. It sets up necessary acceleration structures (BLAS and TLAS), configures the ray tracing pipeline, and dispatches ray tracing commands.
- Shader Management:
 The shaders are presumably contained within the "shader.fxh" file, which is included in the project. These shaders would include the ray generation, miss, and closest hit shaders used in the ray tracing pipeline.

- Miscellaneous:
The code includes various utility functions and DirectX 12 specific structures and API calls to manage resources, handle window messages, and drive the rendering process.
Debugging and Error Handling:

The code includes basic error handling (e.g., checking HRESULT values) and debugging support (e.g., enabling the debug layer).
This code is an excellent starting point for someone looking to understand the basics of a DirectX 12 ray tracing application. However, it's quite advanced and assumes familiarity with both DirectX 12 and ray tracing concepts.

<h2> TLAS and BLAS basics </h2>

In the context of DirectX Raytracing (DXR), which is part of DirectX 12, two key concepts are Bottom Level Acceleration Structures (BLAS) and Top Level Acceleration Structures (TLAS). Understanding these is crucial for implementing efficient ray tracing in graphics applications. Let's break down what each of these structures is and their roles in ray tracing.

<h3> Bottom Level Acceleration Structure (BLAS) </h3>

- BLAS is a data structure that stores a spatial representation of the geometry in your scene. This geometry can be anything from simple triangles to complex meshes. The primary purpose of BLAS is to accelerate the process of ray-geometry intersection tests, which are fundamental to ray tracing. By organizing geometry into BLAS:

- Efficiency: Ray tracing performance is enhanced because rays can quickly test for intersections against a large number of geometric primitives.
Static or Dynamic: BLAS can represent both static and dynamic objects. For dynamic objects, you might need to rebuild or update the BLAS when the geometry changes.

In simpler terms, think of BLAS as a collection of "boxes" where each box contains information about a piece of your geometry, optimized for quick ray intersection tests.

<h3> Top Level Acceleration Structure (TLAS) </h3>
While BLAS deals with raw geometry, TLAS operates at a higher level. TLAS is a data structure that references one or more BLAS and contains information about the placement and transformation of these BLAS in the scene. Essentially, TLAS organizes the instances of the geometry in your scene. Key aspects include:

- Scene Organization: TLAS keeps track of various instances of objects (each referencing a BLAS), their transformations, and their positions in the world.
- Instance Data: Each entry in a TLAS (an instance) points to a BLAS and includes additional data like transformation matrices (to place the object in the world) and material properties.
Dynamic Scenes: TLAS is particularly important for dynamic scenes, as updating object positions, rotations, or scales involves updating the TLAS.

<h3> Relationship between BLAS and TLAS </h3>

In a ray tracing pipeline:

- Ray Generation: Rays are shot into the scene (e.g., from the camera).
- TLAS Intersection: Each ray first interacts with the TLAS. The TLAS directs the ray to potential BLAS candidates based on the ray's direction and origin.
- BLAS Intersection: Once a BLAS is identified, the ray checks for intersections against the geometry within that BLAS.
- Shading: If an intersection is found, shading calculations (like color, lighting, etc.) are performed.

<h3> Why Both BLAS and TLAS? </h3>
Using both BLAS and TLAS allows for more efficient ray tracing. BLAS can be precomputed and reused (especially for static geometry), saving computation time. TLAS enables dynamic scene updates without the need to reprocess the entire geometry, as only the instance information in TLAS needs to be updated. This separation enhances performance and flexibility in rendering complex scenes with ray tracing.

<h3> The tlas and blas consistent between vulkan and dxr? </h3>

The concepts of Top Level Acceleration Structure (TLAS) and Bottom Level Acceleration Structure (BLAS) are consistent between DirectX Raytracing (DXR, part of DirectX 12) and Vulkan Ray Tracing. Both graphics APIs use these structures as part of their respective ray tracing frameworks, and their fundamental roles are the same. However, there are differences in implementation details and API usage between DXR and Vulkan Ray Tracing. Let's look at the similarities and differences:

Similarities in TLAS and BLAS Between DXR and Vulkan
Purpose and Functionality:

Both in DXR and Vulkan, BLAS is used to store geometry data like vertices and triangles, optimizing ray-geometry intersection tests.
TLAS in both APIs organizes instances of objects in the scene, each referencing a BLAS and including transformation matrices and instance-specific data.
Ray Tracing Process:

The process of ray tracing in both APIs involves shooting rays that first interact with the TLAS to identify potential BLAS candidates and then test for intersections against the geometry in the BLAS.

Differences in TLAS and BLAS Between DXR and Vulkan
API Design and Usage:

While the overarching concepts are similar, the specific API calls, structures, and the way these acceleration structures are built and updated can differ between DXR and Vulkan. Each API has its own set of functions, parameters, and methodologies for handling these structures.
Flexibility and Control:

Vulkan is known for giving developers a high degree of control and flexibility, which extends to its ray tracing functionality. This might mean more complex setup and management of TLAS and BLAS compared to DXR, which aims to simplify certain aspects at the cost of direct low-level control.
Integration with the Rest of the API:

DXR is integrated into DirectX 12, and its features are designed to work seamlessly with other DirectX 12 features. Vulkan Ray Tracing is an extension to Vulkan, and while it's designed to integrate well with Vulkan's existing features, the way it interacts with the rest of the Vulkan API might differ from DXR's integration with DirectX 12.

<h3> Platform and Hardware Support: </h3>

The support for ray tracing features can vary based on the hardware and the graphics driver's implementation of DXR or Vulkan. This might affect performance, capabilities, and the availability of certain features in each API.
In summary, while TLAS and BLAS serve the same conceptual roles in both DXR and Vulkan, the actual implementation, API usage, and some capabilities may differ. Developers working with these APIs need to be aware of these differences and understand the specifics of the API they choose to use.
